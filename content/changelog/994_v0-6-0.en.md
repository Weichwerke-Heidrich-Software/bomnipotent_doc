## BREAKING
- Introducing many filter options for the "list" and "download" commands for [bom](/client/consumer/boms/), [component](/client/consumer/bom-components/), [vulnerabiliy](/client/consumer/vulnerabilities/), [csaf](/client/consumer/csaf-docs/), [product](/client/consumer/products/), [user](/client/manager/access-management/user-management/), [user-role](/client/manager/access-management/role-assignment/) and [role-permission](/client/manager/access-management/role-management/). Some of these replace previous options, and the communication between sever and client has also been adjusted in places, which is why this is a breaking change. Albeit not very breaking.

## Added
- Re-sending a request to add a new user with the same key re-triggers the verification email.
- [BOM](/client/manager/doc-management/boms/#uploading) and [CSAF](/client/manager/doc-management/csaf-docs/#uploading) upload accept the option "on-existing" with the variants "error", "skip" and "replace", which controls how conflicts during the upload are handled.
- The commands bom, vulnerability, csaf, product, user, user-role and role-permission support the "exists" subcommand, which reports whether or not at least one object matching some filters exists on the server.

## Changed
- Began migrating from option "email" to "user", by deprecating the former and enabling the latter.
- Robots cannot be assigned the admin role.

## Fixed
- Removing carriage return and other whitespaces from edges of command line arguments.
