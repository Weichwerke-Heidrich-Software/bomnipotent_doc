## BREAKING
- Introducing many filter options for the "list" and "download" commands for [bom](/client/consumer/boms/), [component](/client/consumer/bom-components/), [vulnerabiliy](/client/consumer/vulnerabilities/), [csaf](/client/consumer/csaf-docs/), [product](/client/consumer/products/), [user](/client/manager/access-management/user-management/), [user-role](/client/manager/access-management/role-assignment/) and [role-permission](/client/manager/access-management/role-management/). Some of these replace previous options, and the communication between sever and client has also been adjusted in places, which is why this is a breaking change. Albeit not very breaking.

## Added
- Re-sending a request to add a new user with the same key re-triggers the verification email.

## Changed
- Began migrating from option "--email" to "--user", by deprecating the former and enabling the latter.

## Fixed
- Removing carriage return and other whitespaces from edges of command line arguments.
