## BREAKING
- The existence check command for [BOMs](/client/consumer/boms/#existence), [Users](/client/manager/access-management/user-management/#existence), etc. is "exist" instead of "exist**s**", and in raw mode returns the number of existing entries instead of just "true"/"false".
- Complete replacement of the option "email" with "user", as announced with version [0.6.0](/changelog/v0-6-0/).
- The configurations "[skip_user_verification](/server/configuration/required/smtp/#skipping-user-verification)", "[tmp_admin](/server/configuration/optional/tmp-admin/)" and "[user_expiration_period](/server/configuration/optional/user-expiration-period/)" are found under "[user]". Two of them are further renamed to "skip_verification" and "expiration_period".

## Added
- Expired users are completely removed from the database after a while. The time is configurable via the "[removal_period](/server/configuration/optional/user-expiration-period/#removal-period)" parameter.

## Changed
- The global limit on requests for new users is configurable via the "[user.new_user_dos_prevention](/server/configuration/optional/dos-prevention/#global-request-user-dos-prevention)" parameters.
- The format for specifying datetimes is much more forgiving than before.
- A user whose previous request for an account was denied cannot request new user accounts.

## Fixed
- The association of CSAF documents to BOMs was flawed.
