## BREAKING
- The existence check command for [BOMs](/client/consumer/boms/#existence), [Users](/client/manager/access-management/user-management/#existence), etc. is "exist" instead of "exist**s**", and in raw mode returns the number of existing entries instead of just "true"/"false".
- Complete replacement of the option "email" with "user", as announced with version [0.6.0](/changelog/v0-6-0/).

## Changed
- The global limit on requests for new users is configurable.
- The format for specifying datetimes is much more forgiving than before.

## Fixed
- The association of CSAF documents to BOMs was flawed.
