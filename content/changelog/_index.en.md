These pages list all changes introduced to BOMnipoten Server and Client by various versions. The versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), meaning that all version have the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, and
- the MAJOR version is increased when there is a breaking change for the user. Which ideally never happens.
- the MINOR version is increased for new, non-breaking features.
- the PATCH version is increased for bug fixes.
- a MAJOR version of 0 is used during the betaphase. Here everything shifts to the right: a new MINOR versions means a breaking change, and a new PATCH version any non-breaking change.

It is recommended to always use the latest version.
