## Added
- Periodic tasks can be [configured](/server/periodic-tasks/configuring-tasks/) to be run by the server according to an arbitrary schedule.
- A new periodic task creates a [database backup](/server/periodic-tasks/disabled/database-backup).
- The ["database-backup"](/client/manager/backup-management/) commands allow manually creating and restoring a backup.
- The preconfigured role "robot" simplifies the setup of a [robot user](/client/manager/access-management/robot-users/).
- The commands ["csaf download"](/client/consumer/csaf-docs/#download), ["csaf get"](/client/consumer/csaf-docs/#get) and ["bom match"](/client/consumer/boms/#match) accept a "--provider-metadata" argument to allow interoperability with CSAF providers that ignore the suggestions of the standard regarding the URL path.

## Changed
- Downloading documents from a non-BOMnipotent CSAF server respects the currently stored inventory.

## Fixed
- A new key under an explicitly provided path is correctly generated in ["user request"](/client/basics/account-creation/#storing-keys-at-custom-location), even if a different key already exists at the default path.
