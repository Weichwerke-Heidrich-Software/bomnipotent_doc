## Added
- The command "bom match" find matches between components of provided BOM documents, and vulnerability assessments of CSAF documents on the server.
- The command "csaf match" finds matches between vulnerability assessments of provided CSAF documents and components of BOM documents on the server.

## Changed
- Introduced a caching mechanism for hashes and signatures to improve download performance by a factor of 100.
- BOM to CSAF matching is case-insensitive and trims any leading "v" in the version name.

## Fixed
- BOMnipotent Server can now read encrypted OpenPGP v6 keys, which was previously not possible because of an error in a dependency.
- The ROLIE feed was not quite conforming to [RFC8322](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8322.html), because the "updated" field was nullable.
