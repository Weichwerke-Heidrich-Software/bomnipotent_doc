+++

## Added
- The command ["bom match"](/client/consumer/boms/#match) find matches between components of provided BOM documents, and vulnerability assessments of CSAF documents on the server.
- The command ["csaf match"](/client/consumer/csaf-docs/#match) finds matches between vulnerability assessments of provided CSAF documents and components of BOM documents on the server.
- Introduced "analyze" subcommands for ["bom"](/client/consumer/boms#analyze), ["component"](/client/consumer/bom-components#analyze), ["vulnerability"](/client/consumer/vulnerabilities#analyze), ["csaf"](/client/consumer/csaf-docs#analyze) and ["product"](/client/consumer/products#analyze), which take one or more documents as inputs and display the data of interest in a table.

## Changed
- Introduced a caching mechanism for hashes and signatures to improve download performance by a factor of 100.
- BOM to CSAF matching is case-insensitive and trims any leading "v" in the version name.

## Fixed
- BOMnipotent Server can now read encrypted OpenPGP v6 keys, which was previously not possible because of an error in a dependency.
- The ROLIE feed was not quite conforming to [RFC8322](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8322.html), because the "updated" field was nullable.
