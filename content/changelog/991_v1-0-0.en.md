## BREAKING
- This first full release of BOMnipotent is incompatible with the beta version:
  - The database schema required a breaking overhaul.
  - User key pairs need to follow the OpenPGP standard. Keys created previously to this version do no longer work.

## Added
- [OpenPGP config](/server/configuration/optional/open-pgp/) allowing the server to host a public key and sign documents, thus becoming a CSAF trusted provider.

## Fixed
- Error messages during the initial config loading were not logged.
- The server was unable to start if a tmp_admin was specified in the config.
