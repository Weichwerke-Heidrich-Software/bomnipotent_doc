## Added
- Periodic tasks can be [configured](/server/periodic-tasks/configuring-tasks/) to be run by the server according to an arbitrary schedule.
- A new periodic task creates a [database backup](/server/periodic-tasks/disabled/database-backup).
- The ["database-backup"](/client/manager/backup-management/) commands allow manually creating and restoring a backup.

## Changed
- Downloading documents from a non-BOMnipotent CSAF server respects the currently stored inventory.
