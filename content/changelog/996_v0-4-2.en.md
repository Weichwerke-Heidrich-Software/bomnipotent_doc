## Added
- The ports that the HTTP and HTTPS server bind to are [freely configurable](/server/configuration/optional/port-binding/).
- Logging can be configured to print either to stdout or to a [logfile](/server/configuration/optional/log/#logfile).

## Fixed
- Before removing a user, the server checks if that user exists.
- Special characters in URLs are encoded more thoroughly during internet communication.
