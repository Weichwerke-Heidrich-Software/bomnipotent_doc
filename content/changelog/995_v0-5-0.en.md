## BREAKING
- The server verifies user accounts by sending a cryptographically signed link to the provided email address. This requires an [SMTP section](/server/configuration/required/smtp/) in the config file. This behaviour and thus the need for the SMTP section can be bypassed with another configuration, but because BOMnipotent is secure-by-default, the server does not start if neither is configured.
- The client does not allow approving unverified users. This security measure can be bypassed with the "allow-unverified" flag.

## Added
- Using the "robot" flag, the client can request a robot account intended for automation. This account does not get verified via email, and needs to be approved by again using the "robot" flag.
