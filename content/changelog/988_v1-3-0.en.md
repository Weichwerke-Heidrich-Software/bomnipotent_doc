## Added
- BOMnipotent Client implements most [CSAF retrieving rules](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/os/csaf-v2.0-os.html#73-retrieving-rules). This means that it can, to a limited extend, interoperate with any server acting as a [CSAF provider](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/os/csaf-v2.0-os.html#722-role-csaf-provider).
- Users can revoke their own OpenPGP keys with the ["user revoke key"](/client/basics/account-management/#revoking-keys) command. A revoked key is kept in the database, but does not grant any authentication.

## Fixed
- The database columns for CPE and pURL were restricted to 127 characters, which in some cases is too short. Now they are unrestricted.
