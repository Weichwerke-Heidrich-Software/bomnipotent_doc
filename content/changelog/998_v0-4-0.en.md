## BREAKING
- User accounts now need to exist before they can be assigned any role.
- Explicitly providing an id when modifying a CSAF document is now optional.
- Overhauled logging:
  - The option "output-mode" / "o" now only takes values "normal", "code" and "raw".
  - New option "log-level" / "l" takes "error", "warn", etc.
  - Log file is now specified via "log-file" / "f".
  - Streamlined which combination logs how much to which output.
  - The "raw" output mode now processes the data like everyone else.

## Changed
- During download, the new flag "overwrite" allows to locally overwrite BOM and CSAF documents that have been modified on the server.

## Fixed
- The server can now handle the case where an uploaded BOM contains several vulnerabilities with the same ID.
