In BOMnipotent, permissions are not directly associated with user accounts, but rather with roles. The section about [role management](/client/manager/access-management/role-management/) covers how this association is managed, and the section about [role assignment](/client/manager/access-management/role-assignment/) explains how roles (and thus ultimately permissions) are assigned to users.

The server has several permissions embedded in its code, some of which are hardcoded, some of which are configurable, and all of which are explained here.
