This section describes periodic tasks that are not enabled by default.

You can add [sections](/server/periodic-tasks/configuring-tasks/) for them in your Config.toml file to enable them.

> There is no need to explicitly set the "enabled" parameter to "true". Specifying the name of a task is enough to enable it.
