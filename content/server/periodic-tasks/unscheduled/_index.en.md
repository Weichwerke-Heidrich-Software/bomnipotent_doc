This section describes periodic tasks that are not scheduled by default.

You can add [sections](/server/periodic-tasks/configuring-tasks/) for them in your Config.toml file to add them to the schedule.

> There is no need to explicitly set the "scheduled" parameter to "true". Specifying the name of a task is enough to schedule it.
