BOMnipotent Server comes with some pre-defined tasks that it runs periodically. For example, it regularly [checks](/server/periodic-tasks/enabled/check-for-updates/) if updates are available.

The parameters of tasks, including if and how often they are run, can be [configured](/server/periodic-tasks/configuring-tasks/) in the Congig.toml file.
