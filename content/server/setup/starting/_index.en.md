Several setup variants are presented here. You can pick the one best suited to your needs, and modify it at will. If you do not know where to start, the [setup via docker compose](/server/setup/docker-compose/) is an excellent choice.

After following the steps of one of the variants, your server has a default configuration and should be reachable from the internet. After that, you should [create an admin user account](/server/setup/admin).
