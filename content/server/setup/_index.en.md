This section aims to make setting up your server to host an instance of BOMnipotent Server as easy as possible.

Several setup variants are presented here. You can pick the one best suited to your needs, or modify at will. If you do not know where to start, the [setup via docker compose](/server/setup/docker-compose/) is an excellent choice.

After following the steps of one of the variants, your server has a default configuration and should be reachable from the internet. You can then consult the [next section](/server/configuration/) to configure it to your needs.
