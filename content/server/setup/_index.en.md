This section aims to make setting up your server to host an instance of BOMnipotent Server as easy as possible.

The setup consists of the following, necessary steps:
1. [Start the server.](/server/setup/starting)
1. [Create an admin.](/server/setup/admin)
1. [Activate your subscription](/server/setup/subscription)

After that you can [configure](/server/configuration) the server to your personal needs.
