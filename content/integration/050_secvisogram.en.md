The [Common Security Advisory Framework](https://www.csaf.io/specification.html) (CSAF) is a machine-readable format and international standard for sharing information about cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Its purpose is to inform users of your product how they should react: Do they need to update to a newer version? Do they need to modify a configuration? Is your product even truly affected, or does it maybe never call the affected part of the vulnerable library?

The [CSAF Standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html) by OASIS Open aims to cover a wide range of scenarios. As such, it can be very overwhelming at first. This page serves to highlight the key components a CSAF document requires and offer a practical guide to get started right away.

## Secvisogram

CSAF documents are files in JSON format following a specific schema. As such, they can in principle be created with any text editor. However, CSAF documents need to adhere to a large set of rules which any CSAF provider (and that includes BOMnipotent) needs to check.

Instead, it is recommended to use [Secvisogram](https://github.com/secvisogram/secvisogram). It is an open-source server application with a graphical user interface, originally developed by the German Bundesamt f√ºr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI).

### Local Editor

Probably the most comfortable way to get started with writing CSAF documents is to fork the [local_csaf_editor](https://github.com/aunovis/local_csaf_editor) repository by [AUNOVIS GmbH](https://www.aunovis.de/). It contains a small bash script to locally clone and run Secvisogram, and it encourages you to store versioned CSAF templates.

### Important Document Properties

Document properties provide information on the CSAF document itself. Among other things, they tell you how it can be identified, who created it when, and with whom you can share it.

#### Title

The [Title](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#32111-document-property---title) of the document is meant to tell a human reader what this document is about. It makes sense to include the product name and the type of vulnerability in the title, but there are no formal restrictions.

In Secvisogram, the title is found under "Document level meta-data".

#### Publisher

The [Publisher](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#3218-document-property---publisher) section serves to uniquely identify you, the one publishing the document.

It contains the required fields "name", "namespace" and "category", and the optional fields "issuing authority" and "contact details". The values you provide here should be identical to the ones in your [provider metadata](/server/configuration/required/provider-metadata/#publisher-data-inputs) configuration. The documentation page contains more details on the values you should provide here.

#### Tracking

The [Tracking](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#32112-document-property---tracking) section contains important meta-data about the document. It is primarily meant to be machine readable. The most important fields are:

- [ID:](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#321124-document-property---tracking---id) Together with your publisher namespace, the ID is used to identify a document. It thus needs to be unique within your organisation. Apart from that, the standard only requires that the ID does not start or end with a whitespace. However, it is recommended to only use lowercase letters, digits, and the symbols '+', '-' and '_'. This is because the standard recommends that [filenames](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#51-filename) for CSAF documents follow this pattern. Deviating from it could lead to confusion and even conflicts. There is no good reason for an ID not to be identical to its filename.
- [Initial Release Date](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#321125-document-property---tracking---initial-release-date) and [Current Release Date](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#321122-document-property---tracking---current-release-date) are blissfully self-explanatory fields.
- [Status:](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#321127-document-property---tracking---status) This must be one of "draft", "interim" and "final". The status serves to tell you consumers at which rate the document is expected to change. Before the initial release date, the status must be "draft".
- [Version:](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#321128-document-property---tracking---version) You can either use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), or a [natural number](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/natural-numbers/) as your document version. Before the initial release date of your document, you may choose 0 as the (semantic) major version, or as the natural number version. After the initial release, the number must be at least 1. Whenever you change your document, you have to increment the version. For semantic versions this means increasing at least the patch version, while for natural number versions the number needs to increase at least by 1.


#### Distribution - TLP

Though you are not required to classify the CSAF document, you may want to. This is done using the [Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)](https://www.first.org/tlp/), with which you can limit the information to a single individual, an organisation and its clients, a whole community, or not at all.

This classification has programatical consequences: A document classified as {{< tlp-white >}} or {{< tlp-clear >}} will be publicly shared by BOMnipotent, while documents with another classification require explicit authentication and access to be viewed.

If you do not specify a classification inside the document, BOMnipotent Server will use a configurable [default TLP](/server/configuration/optional/tlp-config/#default-tlp). This does however mean that the TLP information is lost once the document is downloaded from the server, which is why classifying inside the document is recommended.

Please note that the [CSAF Standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#32152-document-property---distribution---tlp) only allows classification with the deprecated [TLP v1.0](https://www.first.org/tlp/v1/) labels. As long as you strictly follow it, the URL in the document should be https://www.first.org/tlp/v1/.

However, many CSAF issuers prefer to classify their documents with the TLP v2.0 label {{< tlp-amber-strict >}}, which only allows sharing within a single organisation. You can [configure BOMnipotent](/server/configuration/optional/tlp-config/#allowing-tlp-v20) to also accept CSAF documents classified using TLP v2.0 labels.

### Important Product Tree Properties

The product tree contains the information which products are covered by the advisory. They are grouped in branches, which, similar to namespaces, serve to structure your catalogue.

#### Branches

Branches always have exactly 3 fields: A [name](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#3123-branches-type---name), a [category](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#3122-branches-type---category), and then either a product or more branches.

This recursive devinition is meant to begin on a high-level overview, and then go down to individual releases. A very plausible structure is the following:
- A top level branch with the category "vendor". The name is your organisation's name.
- The "vendor" branch contains a branch with category "product_name" for each of your products. If they become too numerous, you may consider addionally grouping them in branches with the category "product_family".
- Each "product" branch contains a branch for each "product_version". Here it is important that the name of the branch is actually a version, and not a version range. There is a separate category for that.
- If you build for different architectures, you may want to include a sub-branch with category "architecture".

Whatever branch structure you settle on in the end, the lowermost branches need to contain a product field. It needs to contain the following fields:
- [Name:](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#3131-full-product-name-type---name) A name, ideally unique, that helps human readers to identify the product. This may well just be the concatenation of all branch names leading to this leaf.
- [Product ID:](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#318-product-id-type) The product ID is used to reference this particular product within the current document. It has no particular requirements, besides being unique in the document.

The product may contain a [product identification helper](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#3133-full-product-name-type---product-identification-helper). This is primarily relevant to help others identify your product from outside the current document.

### Important Vulnerabilities Properties

TODO

#### Title

The [title](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#32315-vulnerabilities-property---title) is used so that human readers know which vulnerability is covered by this CSAF document.

#### CVE and IDs

This very important field is used for machines to identify a vulnerability. Several systems for identifying vulnerabilities exist. The most well known is the [Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE)](https://www.cve.org/), which you can TODO
